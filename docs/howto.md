## How to create "issues" when I have a problem

> _**To be able to solve your problem, it is important for us to have as much information as possible**_.

* Describe your problem as detailed as possible.
* Please write your ESPHome and Home Assistant version, as the version of files of this project (TFT, ESPHome and Blueprint).
* Please go to your automation and then to the "3 dots" and then to _**Edit as YAML**_.
Copy the complete code and attach it to the ticket
* An important "helper" for solving problems is the trace of an automation.
You can find the trace under _**Settings --> Automations & Scenes --> your NSPanel automation --> Traces (top right)**_

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD028 -->
> [!NOTE]
> TRACES! Please execute again what does not work and open the trace immediately afterwards.
> Often you have to open the trace after the reboot too.
> During the start up, most things are loaded.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> In the trace you can see by the _**"orange "**_ lines which way the automation has gone.
> Please tell us this path.
> Also, please take one or more screenshots and add them to your ticket.
> Especially important for us is where the _**"Orange "**_ line ends, because most of the time this is also where the problem is.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> When you have opened the trace, there is a _**"timestamp "**_ at the top.
> It is important that you select the correct timestamp.

## Update Blueprint

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To install a new version of the NSPanel, the Blueprint, ESPHome and the TFT must be updated!

1. In Home Assistant, go to Settings > Automation & Scenes, select the tab Blueprints and find the blueprint named "NSPanel Configuration"
2. Click the 3-dot menu and select "Re-import blueprint":

    ![image](https://github.com/Blackymas/NSPanel_HA_Blueprint/assets/94725493/afb433e8-f29c-4b3f-8d6b-16a12b181422)
3. Click "Re-import" button:

    ![image](https://github.com/Blackymas/NSPanel_HA_Blueprint/assets/94725493/1db36411-e5a4-4cef-bcef-575a08019a67)
4. Reload automations or restart Home Assistant.
5. The new Blueprint is now available.
Settings that have already been made are adopted.
6. Please review the blueprint settings (under Automations tab) for new settings available with the new version.

## Update ESPHome
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD028 -->
> [!IMPORTANT]
> To install a new version of the NSPanel, the Blueprint, ESPHome and the TFT must be updated!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These instructions are for updating a panel where an older version of these files are already installed.
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD028 -->

These are the steps to flash your panel with an updated version from this project:

1. Go to the ESPHome dashboard (in your Home Assistant) and find the device you want to update.
    Then click the 3-dot menu and select the option "Clean Build Files" to make sure you clean-up your system from the previous versions files:
    ![Clean Build Files menu](pics/esphome_dashboard_clean_build_files.png)

2. When the clean-up process is done, click on **Install** button:
    ![Install button on Clean Build Files dialog](pics/esphome_dashboard_clean_build_files_install_button.png)

3. As your panel is probably already connected to the Wi-Fi, you may select to install **Wirelessly**,
    as it is much easier and you don't have to unassemble your panel.
    ![image](https://github.com/Blackymas/NSPanel_HA_Blueprint/assets/94725493/c9b53549-c78a-4a02-bcde-31582905d0c4)

The new firmware will be built and then flashed to your panel, which will restart at the end of this process and start sending logs again:

## Update TFT
> [!IMPORTANT]
> These instructions are for updating a panel where an older version of these files are already installed.

1. Go to ***Settings --> Devices & Services --> Integrations***, select the display under the ESPHome integration.
2. Select the "**Update TFT Display - Model**" accordingly, under **Configuration**. 
3. Press the button "**Update TFT Display**".
4. The display starts the update process and then restarts.

## Notification via HA
To show a notification on the NSPanel, the following service call can be used:

```yaml
service: esphome.panelname_notification_show
data:
  label: Example label text
  message: Example message text
```
> [!NOTE]
> For more details about this service call, please refer to our [API documentation](api.md#notification-show-service-notification_show).

To clear any notifications, the following service call can be used:

```yaml
service: esphome.panelname_notification_clear
```
> [!NOTE]
> For more details about this service call, please refer to our [API documentation](api.md#notification-clear-service-notification_clear).

To use the notifications in an automation, again simply use the service call as shown in the example below:

```yaml
description: ""
mode: single
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id:
      - binary_sensor.motion_detector
    to: "on"
    condition: []
    action:
  - service: esphome.panelname_notification_show
    data:
      label: Motion Detected
      message: Example for a Notification on the Panel Screen
```

## Climate control with Relays
> [!ATTENTION]
> Although these instructions are still valid, since v4.0 there is a better way to setup a climate control using the panel's relays an the [add-on climate](addon_climate.md), 
> which will continue to work even if Home Assistant and/or WiFi are not available. 
> You probably only want to use this approach, if you are not using the build-in thermometer. 

In order to use the NSPanel to control a radiator or underfloor heating, at least one Generic Thermostat must be created in the HA.
More information can be found here: https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/generic_thermostat/

Example configuration Generic Thermostat:

```yaml
climate:
  - platform: generic_thermostat
    name: Study
    heater: switch.study_heater ## Wenn das NSPanel Relays den Heizkreis Regler schaltet, kann dieses hier definiert werden
    target_sensor: sensor.study_temperature ## Hier kann der NSPanel Sensor verwendet werden
    min_temp: 15
    max_temp: 21
    ac_mode: false
    target_temp: 17
    cold_tolerance: 0.3
    hot_tolerance: 0
    min_cycle_duration:
      seconds: 5
    keep_alive:
      minutes: 3
    initial_hvac_mode: "off"
    away_temp: 16
    precision: 0.1
```

Afterwards, the climate.entity must be assigned accordingly in the panel configuration.

## Call a Page Directly

In user-created automations within Home Assistant, there are scenarios where you might want to automatically display a specific page on your device's screen.
The following services enable this functionality:

### Basic Pages

To open a specific page, you can utilize the `esphome.xxxxxx_command` service.
Here's an example that demonstrates how to open the `home` page:

```yaml
service: esphome.xxxxx_command
data:
  cmd: page home
```

Currently, the following pages can be accessed using this method:

- `buttonpage01`
- `buttonpage02`
- `buttonpage03`
- `buttonpage04`
- `entitypage01`
- `entitypage02`
- `entitypage03`
- `entitypage04`
- `home`
- `qrcode`
- `screensaver`
- `utilities`

For instance, to directly navigate to button page 2, replace `home` in the command with `buttonpage02`:

```yaml
service: esphome.xxxxx_command
data:
  cmd: page buttonpage02
```
> [!NOTE]
> For more details about this service call, please refer to our [API documentation](api.md#command-service-command).

### Entity-Specific Pages

For entity-specific pages, a more detailed call is required as it involves specifying the entity.
You can use the service `esphome.xxxxx_entity_details_show` as shown in the following example:

```yaml
service: esphome.xxxxx_entity_details_show
data:
  entity_id: climate.my_thermostat
  back_page: buttonpage01
```
> [!NOTE]
> For more details about this service call, please refer to our [API documentation](api.md#entity-details-show-service-entity_details_show).

### Wake-up Page

You may have configured a specific **Wake-up page** on your device.
This page is automatically displayed after the device boots up or wakes up from sleep mode (such as the `screensaver` page).
To open this page, you have two options:

1. Directly call the page if it is one of the [Basic pages](#basic-pages).
2. Use the `esphome.xxxxx_wake_up` service as follows:

   ```yaml
   service: esphome.xxxxx_wake_up
   data:
     reset_timer: true
   ```

    The `reset_timer` parameter allows you to control the **Timeout sleep timer**.
    Setting it to `true` resets the timer, while `false` continues counting down from the current value.

The **Wake-up** service differs from a normal page call in that it only opens the wake-up page if the panel is in sleep mode.
If the panel is already active, the current page remains displayed.
This feature is particularly useful in conjunction with a motion sensor to wake up your panel automatically.
By repeatedly calling this service whenever motion is detected, the panel can be either woken up or have its sleep timeout timer reset (if `reset_timer` is set to `true`).

> [!NOTE]
> For more details about this service call, please refer to our [API documentation](api.md#wake-up-service-wake_up).

## Play RTTTL Sound

HA can send a RTTTL to the NSPanel, custom melodies are possible.

The use this function, the following service is called: `rtttl_play`

You can find many RTTTL strings on the web, the important thing is that they must start with the name and then a colon.

Here is an example:

```txt
The Simpsons:d=4,o=5,b=160:c.6,e6,f#6,8a6,g.6,e6,c6,8a,8f#,8f#,8f#,2g,8p,8p,8f#,8f#,8f#,8g,a#.,8c6,8c6,8c6,c6
```

![HA - Developer Tools - Services - RTTTL Play](pics/ha_developer_tools_services_rtttl_play.png)

More information: https://esphome.io/components/rtttl.html#common-beeps

More songs: https://codebender.cc/sketch:109888#RTTTL%20Songs.ino

> [!NOTE]
> For more details about this service call, please refer to our [API documentation](api.md#rtttl-play-service-rtttl_play).

## Start Automations via Input_Boolean

Although the NSPanel can execute scripts directly over the buttons, there is also the possibility of starting automations directly by the means of Input_Boolean.

For this, a helper must first be created under ***Settings --> Devices&Services --> Helpers***

Now add the created Input_Boolean as a trigger in the desired automation under State.

In the last step, assign the trigger to a button in the Panel Config.

## Updating Wi-Fi settings and OTA Passwords in ESPHome with This Project

### Overview
When you update your Wi-Fi password in a device with firmware from our project,
it's important to remember that the `wifi_password` substitution is used for both Wi-Fi and OTA updates (and a few more places that are not relevant now).
Failing to update both simultaneously can lead to connection issues.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Prepare Your Device for Update**
   - Ensure your device is connected to your computer and is accessible via your current Wi-Fi network.

2. **Update OTA Password First**
   - Open your panel's YAML.
   - Add the following in the customization area:

     ```yaml
     esphome:
       on_boot:
         - priority: 600
           then:
             - lambda: |-
                 id(my_ota).set_auth_password("Your new Wi-Fi password");
     ota:
       password: "Your current Wi-Fi password"
       id: my_ota
     ```

   - Flash your device.
It will use the current password for this flash and will inform your device to start using the new password for the next OTA.
   - When your device starts, **remove the lines above**.
   - Find the `wifi_ssid` and `wifi_password` key in the `substitutions` area (usually at the beginning of the file) and change it to your new Wi-Fi password.
    If that is point to `!secret`, you will have to edit it in your `secrets.yaml` file instead.
   - Flash your device again with the updated YAML.
It will use the current Wi-Fi to connect to your device and the new Wi-Fi password as the OTA password, then will inform your device to connect to the Wi-Fi with the new settings.

3. **Update Wi-Fi Settings in Your Access Point**

### Important Notes

- The device will still be using the old Wi-Fi settings for this update.
If you've already changed your Wi-Fi network settings, this step will fail.
- **Troubleshooting: Unable to Connect via Wi-Fi**
  - If your device cannot connect to Wi-Fi due to a password or SSID change, you will need to flash the device via a serial connection.
  - Connect your device to your computer using a USB-to-Serial adapter.
  - Use the ESPHome flasher tool to upload the new configuration.
  - In this case, don't worry about the OTA password, as it's not required when flashing via serial.

### Verify the Update

- Once the new configuration is uploaded, your device should automatically connect to your Wi-Fi network with the new settings.
- Verify that OTA updates are working with the new password.

### Additional Tips

- **Backup Your Configuration:** Always keep a backup of your ESPHome configuration files.
- **Network Accessibility:** Ensure your device remains within your Wi-Fi network's range during the update process.
- **Serial Flashing:** Familiarize yourself with the process of flashing via serial, as it's a reliable fallback method.

### Conclusion

By carefully updating both your Wi-Fi settings and OTA passwords in your ESPHome configuration, you can avoid connection issues.
Remember to always back up your configuration and be prepared to use a serial connection if Wi-Fi connectivity is lost.
